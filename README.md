# MetaUserDAO-Public-Chain

Metaverse User DAO FOUNDATION is a US-based entity, formerly known as Metaverse User DAO Blockchain Institute, 
with an early foothold in Bitcoin evangelism and mining investment. It has a long history of incubating many high
quality startups in the blockchain industry and traditional internet industry, including many once hot ICO projects, 
distributed storage mines, and the current strong decentralized finance (DeFi) chain tour (Gamefi) and NFT exchange.

MetaUserDAO public chain is a key project incubated by Metaverse User DAO FOUNDATION in the metaverse track, and 
will provide more quality resources and services for the project's growth and development to help it set sail successfully.

As an important component of web3.0 and cross-metaverse infrastructure, MUD will build a decentralized autonomous 
organization public chain based on metaverse identity through community governance, relying on the main body of the
foundation.

Metaverse User DAO FOUNDATION是一家落地美国的实体，前身是 Metaverse User DAO区块链研究所，早期立足于比特币的布道和矿场投资。
在业界有着资深的全过程孵化资历，包括众多曾经火极一时的ICO项目、分布式存储矿场以及当下热头强劲的去中心化金融（DeFi）链游（Gamefi）
、NFT交易所等，在区块链行业及传统互联网产业孵化诸多优质初创项目。

MetaUserDAO 公链是Metaverse User DAO FOUNDATION在元宇宙赛道重点孵化的项目，并在项目成长发展中将为其提供更多优质资源与服务，助力成功启航。
作为web3.0重要组成部件，以及跨元宇宙场景基础设施，MUD将依托基金会主体，通过社区治理，打造一条基于元宇宙身份识别的去中心化自治组织公链。
